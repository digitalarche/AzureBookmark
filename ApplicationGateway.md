If you look for your service (e.g. application gateway) in the catalog, it will take you to the Product Page: 
  https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-gateway/

The product page provides you with an overview about the service and its capabilities. Once you are familiar with the basics, it’s time to move on to the Documentation Page: 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/

The docs page introduces you deeper to the product. But, I am sure that you will have a lot of questions. Did you know that most of the Azure Services have their own Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page? I am sure that it contains most of the questions that you might have. Let’s take a look: 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-faq

The FAQ pages are often very exhaustive. They are ideal to search for keywords. Another very interesting page is the Azure Updates page. Azure updates is the place to find all the release notes about the Azure services. Did you know that you can filter by service type? Lets take a look at the updates to Application Gateway: 
  https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?product=application-gateway

This gives you a great idea of what has been released recently, whats in development and in general, what the hot topics for a technology are. Of course, sooner or later, pricing will be an issue. All of the services have their own Pricing Page: 
  https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/application-gateway/ 

It could be that the limitations of the service are essential as well. Very often, there is a Limits Page: 
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-waf-configuration

The limits page shows restrictions and technical limitations. When you start speaking to your operations people, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) page could become interesting:
