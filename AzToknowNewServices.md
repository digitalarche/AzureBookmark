# How to know a new Service ?

A good point to start is the Azure Service Catalog:

Let’s take the example of the “Azure Application Gateway”.
I will show you a couple of artifacts that exist for most of the Azure services 
but usually are scattered around the internet. 
Knowing that they exist and what they are helps you look for the information you need.
I will use the application gateway as an example, but you can of course use the same idea for any other service.
